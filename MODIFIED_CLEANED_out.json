            "response": "Historical urban planning decisions contributed to San Francisco's pothole issues through:\n\n1. Widening streets and reduced bike lanes: 1950s-60s: Increased vehicle traffic led to wider roads with fewer bike paths, reducing pedestrian and cyclist safety.\n2. Lack of infrastructure maintenance funding: Post-WWII: Reduced federal funding for highway construction and maintenance led to underinvestment in San Francisco's road network.\n3. Rapid growth and gentrification: 1990s-2000s: Increased population and property values strained existing infrastructure, reducing the city's ability to maintain roads.\n\nA comprehensive solution should consider these historical decisions by:\n\n1. Reevaluating urban planning principles: Incorporate more pedestrian-friendly and bike-oriented design into new development projects.\n2. Revitalizing maintenance funding: Increase federal, state, and local investments in road construction and repair, prioritizing vulnerable areas with high traffic volumes.\n3. Prioritizing smart growth and infrastructure upgrades: Implement comprehensive transportation systems to reduce reliance on individual vehicle ownership, like expanded public transit networks or green infrastructure projects.\n4. Community engagement and education: Engage residents and business owners in the planning process to ensure solutions prioritize community needs and promote equitable access to resources.\n\nBy acknowledging historical urban planning decisions and incorporating community feedback into current solutions, San Francisco can develop more effective strategies for addressing its pothole issue and fostering a more sustainable transportation system.",
